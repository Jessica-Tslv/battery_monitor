# 🔋 battery_monitor.sh

## 🧩 Requirements:

🐧 Linux (or macOS with Bash)
🧠 Basic terminal knowledge

## 🎯 Purpose:

Batteries remain at their healthiest state when their capacity stays between 20% and 80%, avoiding extremes such as full charging or deep depletion. ✨

This is a simple Bash script I created to help keep my new MacBook’s battery healthier for longer. 🌱

It alerts you when the battery is too low or too high, so you can unplug or plug in your charger at the right time. 🕰️

## 🔖 How to Use:

1. Create the script file:

`nano battery_monitor.sh`

or

`vim battery_monitor.sh`

2. Paste the script content into the editor and save it.

In Nano: press Ctrl + O, then Enter, then Ctrl + X

In Vim: type :wq and press Enter

3. Make the script executable

`chmod +x battery_monitor.sh`

 4.  Run it manually

`./battery_monitor.sh`
